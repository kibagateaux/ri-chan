2. Amount of Locations, experiences, and reviews in crowdsourced database
    1. show value they get from adding - network effect from community efforts
    2. easy for people to add locations/reviews (conversational, daily prompts during trip, tag agent in social posts)

### Guiding First Principles
Reliability: Ensure the app feels dependable, even in remote areas with spotty connectivity.
Cultural Sensitivity: Respect and celebrate Japanese culture in every aspect of the experience.
Brand Identity: Build a recognizable identity tied to adventure, connection, and the allure of Japan.
Stay Focused: Every decision should enhance the core goal of simplifying group travel to Japan. Avoid distractions that don’t serve this purpose.
Question Norms: Rethink traditional travel app approaches by prioritizing conversation and collaboration over rigid structures.

Design Thinking Mindset: Engage in the socractic method with users to question the users true intention, what they are actually trying to accomplish, and provide  their true wishes.
Empathy First: Deeply understand the emotions and challenges of group travel to create a solution that resonates.
Iterate Boldly: Test ideas early, learn from failures, and refine quickly to build something users love.

### Strategies for Value and Virality
1. Effortless First Impression
Make the initial experience welcoming and quick, showing users immediate value (e.g., a sample itinerary).

Keep users engaged with timely, relevant updates or ideas for their trips.
Analyze the group dynamics, their mood from recent messages, trip itinerary for personality types and hobbies for even more personal suggestions.

Create opportunities for users to connect with others, turning individual trips into shared experiences.

4. Unexpected Joy
Add small, delightful touches—like travel tips or cultural insights—that enhance the experience without overwhelming users.
